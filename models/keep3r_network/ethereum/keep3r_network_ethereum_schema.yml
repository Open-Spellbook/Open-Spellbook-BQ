  description: 'Sometimes a protocol would want to upgrade their automation contracts
    (aka job) and would need to migrate their credicts, instead of unstaking (which
    takes weeks), a protocol shuts down the old job address, and continues exactly
    as it was with the new address. This tracks the old to new address migration for
    a job.
